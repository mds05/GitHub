### A Simple Text Editor
It's a project based on Java, Object-Oriented Programming and Stacks to write whatever you wish. I made this to clear my basics of stacks and be aware of it's real world use case.
##### Command Summary:
- delete  -  Delete the last character
- undo    -  Undo the last action (removes the last change you made).
- redo    -  Redo the last undone action (restores the last undone change).
- display -  Display the current text.
- exit    -  Exit the editor (ends the editing session).

Anything else that you type will be counted as a text message from your end.
